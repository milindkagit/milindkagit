- 👋 Hi, I’m @milindkagit
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and music.
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring raspberry PI (✨) ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on especially stable bootloaders on Pi :smiley: I can see there is quite interesting work by Pi Firmware Task Force. 
However currently I dont see any simple solution for end user thats reliable, stable and flexible. OSes are optimized on an ongoing basis, so pi(ARM64) bootloader needs to support new OSes. Also one should not loose existing work and data. so it needs to be stable and flexible.
